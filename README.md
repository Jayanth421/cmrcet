Project overview

CMR Smart Presentation Portal is designed for educational institutions to manage presentation uploads, class materials, and live smartboard sessions. The system supports:

- Role-based access: Admin, Faculty, Student, Smartboard
- Secure authentication with access + refresh tokens, OTP email verification on registration
- File upload and streaming via Supabase storage (or alternative providers)
- Smartboard pairing via QR session exchange for in-class presentations
- Admin analytics and management for departments, classes, subjects, and users

Features

- User registration and login with role-aware validation and OTP email verification
- Access token (short lived) and refresh token (long lived) flow with revocation
- Student and Faculty dashboards with upload/listing/download/view support
- Supabase-backed upload flow and signed download URLs
- Smartboard token exchange flow for pairing and session control
- Security middleware: Helmet, CORS, rate limiting, centralized error handling
- Optional Python SMTP bridge for environments where Node mailers are restricted

Architecture & Tech stack

- Frontend: React (Vite), Tailwind CSS, React Router, Axios, Context API
- Backend: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB (Mongoose), JWT, bcrypt
- Storage: Supabase Storage (preferred) — signed URLs for uploads/downloads
- Dev tooling: PM2, Nginx (for reverse proxy), optional Docker

Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ (or current LTS)
- npm or yarn
- MongoDB (local, Atlas, or other hosted DB reachable by MONGO_URI)
- (Optional) Supabase project and service role key for storage operations
- (Optional) Python 3 if using MAIL_PROVIDER=python

Quick start

Backend (development)

1. Open a terminal, go to backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit backend/.env and fill MONGO_URI, JWT secrets, SUPABASE_* if using Supabase
npm run dev
```

The dev script runs the server with nodemon (or an equivalent). The server listens on the port configured via PORT.

Frontend (development)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit env.local to set VITE_API_BASE_URL and any frontend keys (e.g., VITE_SUPABASE_URL, VITE_SUPABASE_KEY)
npm run dev
```

Open the frontend dev server (usually http://localhost:5173) and the backend API (e.g., http://localhost:3000).

Environment variables (high-level)

backend/.env (important variables)

- PORT - server port
- MONGO_URI - MongoDB connection string
- JWT_ACCESS_SECRET - JWT access token secret
- JWT_REFRESH_SECRET - JWT refresh token secret
- ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRY - e.g. 1h
- REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRY - e.g. 30d
- SMTP_HOST / SMTP_PORT / SMTP_USER / SMTP_PASS - for direct SMTP
- MAIL_PROVIDER - "node" (default) or "python" if using the Python bridge
- PYTHON_BIN - path to Python when using python mail bridge
- STORAGE_PROVIDER - "supabase" or "local"
- SUPABASE_URL - if using Supabase
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY - required for server-side signed URL operations
- SUPABASE_STORAGE_BUCKET - bucket name

frontend/.env.local (examples)

- VITE_API_BASE_URL - e.g. http://localhost:3000
- VITE_SUPABASE_URL - optional (public project URL)
- VITE_SUPABASE_KEY - optional (publishable key for direct client operations)

Demo accounts & seeding

A seed script is available to populate demo Admin / Faculty / Student accounts for local testing.

```bash
cd backend
npm run seed:mongo
```

Default demo credentials (only for local/dev):

- Admin: admin@cmrcet.ac.in / Admin@123
- Faculty: faculty.demo@cmrcet.ac.in / Faculty@123
- Student: 22h51a0501@cmrcet.ac.in / Student@123

Storage and uploads (Supabase)

The backend generates server-signed upload URLs (or direct signed download URLs) using the Supabase service role key. For production safety:

- Keep SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY on the server only — never in frontend envs.
- If you want client-side direct uploads, implement a server-signed URL endpoint that validates user role and intent.

Smartboard flow

- Faculty creates/starts a smartboard presentation session which issues a QR code.
- Smartboard device scans the QR and exchanges a temporary token to pair with the faculty session.
- Smartboard receives limited session credentials and can request approved presentation URLs from the server.

Running in production

- Build the frontend (npm run build) and serve via Nginx or an S3 + CloudFront static site.
- Run the backend under PM2 or as a systemd service, behind Nginx as reverse proxy.
- Use HTTPS, set secure cookie flags, and configure strong CORS rules.

Suggested Nginx reverse proxy snippet (example)

- point Nginx at the backend API and the static frontend build directory

Security notes

- Use Helmet and enable rate-limiting to reduce attack surface.
- Store JWT secrets in a secrets manager in production.
- Enforce strong password policies and limit OTP attempts.
- Revoke refresh tokens on logout and critical account changes.

Development notes & useful commands

- Run backend tests (if present): `cd backend && npm test`
- Run frontend lint/build: `cd frontend && npm run lint` / `npm run build`
- Seed local DB: `npm run seed:mongo`
- Start both local servers concurrently: consider using `concurrently` or a docker-compose setup for convenience

Contributing

- Fork the repo and open a pull request with a clear description and tests where applicable.
- Follow existing code style and add unit/integration tests for new features.

Troubleshooting

- "Cannot connect to MongoDB": confirm MONGO_URI and network access (Atlas IP whitelisting or SRV formatting)
- "Supabase upload errors": ensure SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY is set and bucket exists
- "Emails not sending": check MAIL_PROVIDER value, SMTP connectivity, or PYTHON_BIN when using python bridge
